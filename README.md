template for a RWD design

Hello friends.

This is homegrown, a RWD design template that I am attempting to create a basic starting point for some
designs going forward and/or another iteration of a web design template.

I am using Entypo for my icon fonts because umm.. they look cooler. They can be found at http://www.entypo.com/
And I am trying to faciliate a RWD grid that I like as oppossed to the big dogs that haunt the net.

Stay tuned for random updates. And I am glad I figured the GUI for Github instructions on the net somehow. 
I will get more comfortable with Terminal as my time goes forward but gosh darn it. I need stuff up now.

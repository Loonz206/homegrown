      <p class="lead">Chris' Collective Hair Systems was a project undertaken that was a challenge in Responsive Web Design using a frame work that was a new concept to me.</p>
      <p>The goal of getting the site up and going was a simple front facing website that would replace their existing site. I used current practices in creating a experince that would work in modern browsers, as well as using a new framework Foundation 4.</p>

    <p>It was real important that the site was made scalable so anyone can see the materials inside. Working with this group was a fun experience and I felt the use of responsive design is a long lasting idea that will be a foundation on how I design going forward. I hope to work with them again in the near future.</p>

    <p class="lead">What a fun school project this one was! Ecommerce creation from a concept that we came up with on our own. I wanted to do a store that dealt in european styled clothing for Americans.</p>       
    <p>Everything in creating this store was done by the process of thinking from the user. Sometimes when we buy things online we get frustrated with controls and functionality. Shopping online should seem seamless and easy.</p>

  <p>Incredibly focused on making iterations and designs for the entire web experience, I use methods that are tried and true to implementing web experiences from the mobile to the desktop. A firm believer in working closely with development and stakeholders the best means to implement concepts is working together on a project as a team.</p>
  <p>Following the latest blogs and articles on RWD and Progressive enhancement I am a avid believer that the world we live in is evolving from traditional business models and it is up to us to convey how to approach needs and business requirements in the best model possible by making mistakes often and early to replicate the best model going forward.</p>
  <p>Test early, test often.</p>
